The core code implements the basic 1wire discovery methods.
Code size is about 1.4k, 1.2k if you remove discovery (SEARCH ROM).
Overdrive speed is not yet implemented.

The 64-bit ID (actually an 48-bit ID because family code and CRC
are fixed) is currently hardcoded, but will be read from EEPROM
Real Soon Now.


NOTE: It appears that Dallas Semiconductor doesn't like people who
implement 1wire slaves in software.

On the other hand, they do discontinue ICs like the DS2423 counter
for which no substitute exists.

Therefore, while I cannot prevent people from doing whatever they want,
simulations of existing ICs will only be entered into this project's
repository if the ICs are no longer available or (at the very least)
"not recommended for new design". Sorry.
